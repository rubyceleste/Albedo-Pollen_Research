# Albedo-Pollen_Research

Step 1
Run pollen_modern.R code first, making sure pollen_modern_pivot.RDS is saved
  RDS files come from data folder
  
Step 2
Run pollen_time.R, making sure pollen_time-full.RDS is saved 

Step 3
Run bluesky_process.R


monthly_ABOVE.R



albedo_figures.R
  figures showing how each varible are related to each other 

snow_probability.R is the code for snow prob from MODIS data, saves df with x,y,LCT and snow prob from jan-dec. modern data

  
elevation.R adds elevation data for coordinates, final df all-data.RDS includes x,y,LCT,elevation,finealb,snowprob


figures_main.R uses pollen-modern-proportions.RDS which is proportions of all taxon. comes from pollen_modern????
albedo_figure.R 
  both figure files need to be cleaned and more detailed descriptions of figures




#all scripts here good to be pushed
